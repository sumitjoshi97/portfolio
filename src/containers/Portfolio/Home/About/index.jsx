      <span className="green">&nbsp;Sumit Joshi</span>, a
      <span className="red">&nbsp;front-end software developer&nbsp;</span>
      based in Delhi, India. I am comfortable throughout the stack, but my
      passion lies in front-end, at the intersection of code and design.
      <br />
      Being a <span className="red">self-taught developer</span>, I have a
      passion for code and an innate drive to learn.
      <br />
      Outside of code, I like to <span className="red">&nbsp;draw</span>, play
      <span className="red">&nbsp;video games</span> and convert my ideas into
      fun video games.
